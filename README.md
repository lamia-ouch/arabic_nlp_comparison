## Background

After collecting Tweets and posting about machine learning methods for an
<a href="https://github.com/mapmeld/aoc_reply_dataset">AOC Reply Dataset</a>
I wanted to evaluate existing open source libraries to see how
easily I could do sentiment analysis on a non-political dataset of Arabic-language
Tweets. In this case the subject is @NetflixMENA, which frequently Tweets
in Arabic with a focus on the Middle East and North Africa market.
